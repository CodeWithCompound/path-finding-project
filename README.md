## Features

![done](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-done-brightgreen)
-  the agent which can move to a target
-  setting a target (left click) & removing a target (right click)

![wip](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-blue)
- the newest version hasn't been pushed since it's really buggy, try fixing those bugs
- the agent currently just.. well goes in a straight line, i may add some turning and angles to make it feel more natural
- when moving the cursor outside the observation window everything just stops... which is, somewhat cool? but it feels weird, i'll have to decide if i'm going to change that
